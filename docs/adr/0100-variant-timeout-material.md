## Context

When a player's clock runs out, the win is downgraded to a draw if the opponent could not have won
anyway — a lone king cannot force mate, so flagging against one is not a loss. `canMate` in
`packages/game/src/game.ts` implemented that test, and `endByTimeout` called it as
`canMate(this.state.position.fen(), winner)`: the FEN and the colour, and **not the variant**.

Two consequences, both live on variants the lobby offers:

1. `parseFen(fen)` defaulted to `standard`, so nothing variant-specific in the position was read.
2. The classical material test — lone king, K+N and K+B cannot force mate — was applied to variants
   where checkmate is not the win condition at all.

Measured before the change, all returning `false` (i.e. "cannot win", so the timeout became a draw):

| position | variant | correct answer |
|---|---|---|
| bare king | `kingofthehill` | can win — walk to the centre |
| bare king | `racingkings` | can win — reach the eighth rank |
| K + queen **in hand** | `crazyhouse` | can win — one drop from mate |
| K+N | `threecheck` | can win — a knight gives checks |
| K+N | `atomic` | can win — a knight delivers the explosion |

Recorded as "per-variant timeout material rules" under Milestone 2 in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Decisions

### 1. `canMate` takes the variant and answers the variant's own question

The signature becomes `canMate(fen, color, variant = 'standard')`, and `endByTimeout` passes
`this.state.variant`. The default keeps every existing caller and test on the standard rule.

The rule per variant, and why:

- **`standard` / `chess960`** — checkmate is the win condition, so the classical test stands: a lone
  king, K+N and K+B cannot force mate; two minors can.
- **`kingofthehill`, `racingkings`** — both are won by walking a king somewhere. A player reduced to
  a bare king still holds the only piece the win condition needs, so material can never rule it out.
- **`crazyhouse`** — pieces in hand can be dropped and the board does not show them. The deciding
  point is that **a king captures like any other piece**, so even a bare king with an empty pocket can
  take something and drop it back. No material state rules a win out, which makes the guard
  inapplicable rather than merely generous.
- **`horde`** — White is a pawn army with no king and wins by mating; Black wins by capturing every
  white piece, and a king captures perfectly well on its own. As in Crazyhouse, the guard does not
  apply.
- **`threecheck`** — won by giving three checks, so the two-minor threshold is irrelevant: a single
  knight checks. Only a bare king cannot, and capturing does not help it — no capture turns a king
  into a piece that gives check.
- **`atomic`** — won by exploding the enemy king. A king may not capture without exploding itself, so
  unlike the two above, a bare king cannot even begin; any other piece can deliver the capture.

The split between the first two and the last two is a king's capture: in Crazyhouse and Horde it
makes progress toward the win, in Three-check it cannot create a checking piece, and in Atomic it is
not available at all.

### 2. Conservative in one direction, deliberately

The function answers "could this side possibly win", and where the honest answer is unclear it says
yes. The two failure modes are not symmetric: handing a draw to a player who was winning takes
something from them, while the guard exists only to spare an opponent a loss they could never have
converted. Erring toward "yes" leaves the normal timeout result intact.

The first version of this ADR stated that bias and then broke it in the same breath: `crazyhouse`
returned false for a bare king with an empty pocket, and a test asserted that draw as correct. The
reasoning that a king can capture and seed its own pocket had actually been considered and then not
applied — the stricter rule shipped anyway, with a test that locked it in. Caught in the review of
PR #97 and corrected here; `horde` had the same defect for a bare black king.

The lesson is the one the bias exists to encode: when the analysis says "this side could still find a
way", the rule has to say so too, or the guard quietly reintroduces the bug it was written to remove.

## Consequences

- A timeout in an offered variant is now resolved by that variant's rules. The most visible change:
  in King of the Hill a bare king wins on time instead of drawing.
- Standard and Chess960 behaviour is unchanged, and the default argument keeps existing callers
  correct.
- Mutation-verified: dropping the `variant` argument at the call site fails the King of the Hill
  test.

## Out of scope

- Insufficient-material *during play* (`Position.hasInsufficientMaterial`), which already guards
  itself to `standard` and `chess960` and needed no change.
- Any change to how flagging itself is detected.
