// Deliberately not `export *`, for the same reason as `check-counters.ts` below: the rights
// bookkeeping is how this package maintains castling state, and publishing it invites a second
// copy of that logic. Only `NO_CASTLING_ROOK` is exported, because `CastlingRights` is public and a
// caller reading `state.castling` needs to know what marks an absent right. The `CastlingRights`,
// `ColorCastlingRights` and `CastlingSide` types themselves come from `./types` above.

// Deliberately not `export *`. The field-shape predicates and the counter-field parsers are how
// the codec reads a FEN, and `check-counters.ts` exists so that the conversion lives in one
// place; publishing them invites a second one. Raised in the CodeRabbit review of PR #140.
