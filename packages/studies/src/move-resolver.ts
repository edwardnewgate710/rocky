 * leaves `Qh5+`. The engine writes `Qh5+`, which bares to `Qh5`, so the two never meet and a
 * perfectly ordinary annotated move fails to resolve. `isSanShaped` in `pgn-parse.ts` already used

 * both are — and a second implementation of them is a second opportunity to disagree with the
 * first. Matching against the engine's own output cannot disagree with it by construction.
 *
 * Check and mate suffixes are ignored on both sides: a file that says `Qh5` where the engine says
 * `Qh5+` is describing the same move, and rejecting it would fail on a large fraction of real
 * exports for no gain.
