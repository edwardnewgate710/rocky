/**
 * The finished-game port (ADR-0130).
 *
 * `TournamentLiveView` answers "what is being played right now" and deliberately drops any game
 * that is over (`durable-live-view.ts`). Tournament commentary needs the opposite set — only games
 * that are over — so it gets its own port rather than a flag on that one: the live projection's
 * whole contract is that everything in it is still running, and a caller that could ask it for
 * finished games would be asking a different question of the same name.
 *
 * The port exists because a finished game's authoritative state is the durable event log, which
 * lives in the composition root. `TournamentLiveView` is arranged the same way and for the same
 * reason: the API layer states what it needs, and the root — the one place that holds an
 * `EventStore` — supplies it.
