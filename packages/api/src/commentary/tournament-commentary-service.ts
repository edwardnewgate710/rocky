 * The API-owned Tournament Commentary service (ADR-0130).
 *
 * Two questions, one rule: **the caller names a resource, the server supplies every fact.** The
 * routes above this service carry path identifiers and an empty body, and every value that reaches
 * a prompt — the position, the move, the players, the results, the standings — is read here from
 * the tournament aggregate and the durable game log. A caller cannot describe a game that was never
 * played, and cannot decide how much engine or provider budget their request spends.
 *
 * The library feature this wraps (`TournamentCommentator`) accepts all of that from its caller,
 * because in M9 its caller was a test. Productionizing it is mostly the work of taking those
 * parameters away.
