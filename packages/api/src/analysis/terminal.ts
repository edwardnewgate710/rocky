 * Terminal-position adjudication at the API boundary (ADR-0116).
 *
 * A finished game has an outcome, not an evaluation. Asking a chess engine to score a position with
 * no legal moves produces nothing to score, and `UciEngineInstance.assembleResults` fills the gap
 * with a placeholder `{ cp: 0, depth: 0 }` — reasonable as an internal "no scored info" marker, and
 * a lie the moment it reaches a client as an evaluation. Checkmate was being reported as `+0.00`,
 * dead level, by both `POST /v1/analysis` and Move Explanation.
 *
 * The fix belongs here rather than in the engine package: `EngineResult` is consumed by anti-cheat
 * and the bot mover as well, and changing what it means for every consumer to correct a presentation
 * defect on two HTTP surfaces is a far larger blast radius than the defect. The API owns its own
 * responses, and it already owns an authoritative rules engine.
