/**
 * Bounded reproduction pass for the Signature B failure (ADR-0140 §4): a `packages/api` test-file
 * subprocess that dies with a bare `'test failed'`, no assertion, no stack, and none of its own
 * tests reported.
 *
 * Every run is instrumented on both sides of the process boundary at once:
 *
 * - **Child side** — `signature-b-preload.cjs` is `--require`d into each per-file child and records
 *   which JS lifecycle path, if any, the child took before dying.
 * - **Parent side** — the built-in `tap` reporter writes to a file while `spec` keeps stdout. That
 *   pairing is the point: Node's runner attaches the child's `exitCode` and `signal` to the error it
 *   throws, `spec` discards them (its `formatError` replaces the error with `error.cause`, the bare
 *   string `'test failed'`), and `tap` serializes them into its YAML block. Running both recovers
 *   the exit status without a custom reporter, without patching Node internals, and without changing
 *   what a human sees on stdout. It is also the only place a dying child's own fatal banner
 *   survives: the runner re-emits child stderr as `test:stderr` reporter events, so a heap
 *   exhaustion's `FATAL ERROR:` lands in the report and never on this process's stderr.
 *
 * The pass is **bounded by construction** and stops at the first capture. The wall-clock ceiling is
 * an absolute deadline enforced *during* a run, not merely consulted before starting another, and
 * expiring it kills the whole process tree — `node:test` spawns one child per test file, so killing
 * only the process this script started would leave workers behind on POSIX. It never retries a
 * failed file and never reruns the suite to get a green result — those would hide the defect rather
 * than explain it.
 *
 * Concurrency is **matched, not lowered**: each run passes the same `--test-concurrency=1` that
 * `packages/api`'s own `npm test` passes, so the pass measures the configuration CI and developers
 * actually run, which is the configuration under which every occurrence has been observed. Running
 * it at Node's default parallelism would be a different experiment, not a stricter one.
 *
 * A pass that captures nothing proves nothing beyond "not observed in N runs", and the printed
 * summary says so; a pass containing a run whose report could not be read says it is inconclusive
 * instead.
 *
 * Usage, from `packages/api` (compile first: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`):
 *
 *     node ./test/diagnostics/run-signature-b-pass.mjs \
 *       [--runs 20] [--max-minutes 45] [--out <dir>] [--target <glob>]
